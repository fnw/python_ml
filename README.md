# python_ml

This is a repository I use to keep all the Machine Learning algorithms I've developed in one place. I have developed these algorithms either for some class I took or just for practice.

**Update 26/03/2021:** I've revived this repository. I've been using it mainly as a study tool, in order to implement algorithms I haven't worked 
with before or haven't worked with in a long time. I will most likely be adding algorithms from Stanford's CS229 class and Bishop's PRML book (back to basics!).
Later on I might move on to stuff that's closer to what I actually work with (mainly Deep Learning).

Some of the code follows scikit-learn conventions, but not all of it does. In particular, none of the Ensemble methods do. Furthermore, even the ones that **do** follow the conventions are not guaranteed to pass scikit-learn tests.

There are some simple tests, but I can't guarantee that these algorithms are correct for every possible case. Think of them more as a reference.

Documentation will be improved with time.

## Dependencies

* Python >= 3.8 (Haven't tested with older versions)
* Scikit-learn >= 0.24.1

I have installed these dependencies using conda, so keep in mind that other packaging systems might have different versions for scikit-learn's dependencies. 

Also, if you're looking for libraries for Ensemble Methods, check out [brew](https://github.com/viisar/brew) and [DESlib](https://github.com/Menelau/DESlib)
