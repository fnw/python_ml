# python_ml

This is a repository I use to keep all the Machine Learning algorithms I've developed in one place, or at least the ones that are good enough to be used again. I have developed these algorithms either for some class I took or just for practice.

Some of the code follows scikit-learn conventions, but not all of it does. In particular, none of the Ensemble methods do. Furthermore, even the ones that **do** follow the conventions are not guaranteed to pass scikit-learn tests.

There are some simple tests, but I can't guarantee that these algorithms are correct for every possible case. Think of them more as a reference.

Documentation will be improved with time.

## Dependencies

* Python > 2.7
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

Also, if you're looking for libraries for Ensemble Methods, check out [brew](https://github.com/viisar/brew) and [DESlib](https://github.com/Menelau/DESlib)
